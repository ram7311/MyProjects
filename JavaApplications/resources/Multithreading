Multitasking
Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:

Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)

At least one process is required for each thread.
one process can have multiple threads.
 At a time one thread is executed only.

Thread
A thread is smallest unit of processing uses a shared memory area.
Threads share the same address space'
Cost of communication between the thread is low.(Switching between Threads is easy)
Threads are independent. If there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It uses a shared memory area.


Process 
Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.
A process is heavyweight.
Cost of communication between the process is high

---------------------------Java Thread class----------------------

Java provides Thread class to achieve thread programming. 
Thread class provides constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread. 
Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface
