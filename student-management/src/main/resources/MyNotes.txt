@GetMapping instead of @RequestMapping to specify which type using ex.get,post
@Repository-->used over a persistence class and help us in exception handling it does @Component(Create object for the class) work also
@Autowired--> for dependency Injection
@ResponseBody-->we return jsp page name from controller, if we want to show some data on webpage without jsp then this annotation is useful,
				it sends method content as httpsresponseBoday to the webPage
return "redirect:/thankyou";--> it will redirect to another controller method where @GetMapping("/thankyou") note:(@ResponseBody shouldn't be
								for "redirect:/thankyou" this controller)..finnally it is for communication between the controller methods
								
@ModelAttribute--> to add attribute
Student student = new Student;
model.addAttribute("students", student);

easy way @ModelAttribute("students") Student student
